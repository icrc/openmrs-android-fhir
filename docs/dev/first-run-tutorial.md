# Tutorial (spotlight tour)

An in-app tour of the screens (`ui/tutorial`). It is entirely local: no server, no account, no
analytics. There are three kinds of tour: the first run, the login page, and one per screen.

## Pieces

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `TutorialStep` / `TutorialAction` | One step: the key of the element to highlight, a title and a body, and what the user does: `Tap` the element or `Acknowledge` the card |
| `TutorialController` | The state of the tour (one at a time) and where each element is, in window coordinates |
| `Modifier.tutorialTarget(key)` | Anchors a step to a composable: reports its bounds and watches taps |
| `TutorialOverlay` | Draws the tour above the whole window and enforces the flow. `MainActivity` hosts it in a `ComposeView` added with `addContentView`, to cover the app bar and the bottom bar |
| `FirstRunTutorial` | The first-run tour and its once-only flag |
| `ScreenTours` | The tour of each screen |

## Targeting

```kotlin
Card(
  modifier = Modifier
    .tutorialTarget(TutorialTargets.HOME_PATIENTS) // before the clickable
    .clickable(onClick = onOpenPatients),
)
```

The element works as before: the target only observes taps and consumes nothing. A step may point at
an element of a screen that is not open yet (the tap of the previous step opens it): until it appears
the overlay blocks the screen, and after 4 seconds the tour ends. A target below the fold is scrolled
into view.

## How a step is enforced

* `Tap`: the element is left uncovered and panels block everything else, so the tap both advances the
  tour and does its normal job.
* `Acknowledge`: the whole window is blocked and the card's button moves on.
* The card always has **Skip tour** and a close button, and Back ends the tour: there is no way to be
  stuck. The card is a live region, so TalkBack reads each step.

## The tours

**First run.** `FirstRunTutorial` keeps a flag in its own preferences file. `FhirApplication.onCreate`
sets it once, to `firstInstallTime == lastUpdateTime`: a fresh installation gets the tour and an update
of an app already in use does not. `HomeFragment` starts the tour when it is laid out, and the flag is
cleared as the tour starts, so it never repeats. The manifests set `allowBackup="false"`, so
reinstalling runs it again. To see it again on a device, write `<boolean name="pending" value="true" />`
in `shared_prefs/first_run_tutorial.xml`.

**Login page.** The "?" in the footer starts it, as often as wanted. `LoginScreen` builds the steps
from what the page offers (basic, SSO, guest) and hosts its own `TutorialOverlay`, being a separate
activity. All its steps are `Acknowledge`, so the page cannot be left during the tour.

**Screens.** `ScreenTours` maps each navigation destination to a `Tour`. `MainActivity` shows the "?"
action (`menu/help_menu.xml`) only when the screen on show has a tour, and `startScreenTour()` starts
it. Its steps are all `Acknowledge`. A step is `optional` when its element may be absent (an empty
list, an action only some users have): it is skipped instead of ending the tour. Views that are not
composables are listed in `Tour.viewTargets` (key to view id). A screen without a tour (identifier
choice, the patient dialog of a group session, unsynced resources) has no "?".

## When a feature changes

A change that adds, moves, renames or removes a feature, screen, setting or control updates the
tutorial in the same change:

1. Tag the element with `Modifier.tutorialTarget(TutorialTargets.X)` (add the key to
   `TutorialTargets`; one element per key, so tag the first item of a list). An XML screen lists the
   view id in the tour's `viewTargets`.
2. Add the step to the screen's tour in `ScreenTours.kt`. A new screen needs a new `Tour` and a
   `forDestination` entry. Use `optional = true` for an element that is not always there.
3. Add `help_<screen>_<element>_title` and `_body` in `values`, `values-fr`, `values-es`, `values-ru`
   and `values-ar` (`StringResourcesTest` fails if one is missing).
4. Mention the step in the CHANGELOG entry.
5. A removed or renamed feature: update or delete its step and strings.
6. Run the tour on a device: every step, and a missing `optional` step must not stop it.
