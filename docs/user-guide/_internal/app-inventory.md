# App inventory (Phase 0)

What the app is, built from the code in this repository. The user guide documents only what is
listed here. Anything not confirmed from the code is marked `TODO: verify`.

## Tech stack

| Area | What the code uses |
|---|---|
| Language / build | Kotlin, Gradle Kotlin DSL, `minSdk 26` |
| Modules | `core` (library with nearly all the code), `app` (application shell), `dev3-app` (the same shell with its own configuration; the release APK of the CI) |
| UI | Jetpack Compose screens hosted by fragments (`ui/screens`, `ui/patient`); the forms are drawn by the form library's own `QuestionnaireFragment` (Android views) |
| Navigation | One navigation graph, `reference_nav_graph`, inside `MainActivity` (a `DrawerLayout`); `SplashActivity`, `LoginActivity`, `UnlockActivity` and `SettingsScanActivity` are separate activities |
| DI | Dagger 2 (`di/`) |
| Data | Room `AppDatabase`, DataStore and SharedPreferences, the Android FHIR SDK's own database (offline first) |
| Network | Retrofit + OkHttp; FHIR R4 under `/ws/fhir2/R4/` and the OpenMRS REST API under `/ws/rest/v1/`; the FHIR SDK's sync workers |
| Auth | Basic (user name and password) or OpenID Connect (single sign-on through AppAuth); offline login with fingerprint, face or screen lock |
| Languages | English (default), French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic (right to left), `values*/strings.xml`; the language is chosen inside the app (Settings) |
| Build variants | `debug` (application id suffix `.debug`, clear-text http allowed through `core/src/debug/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`) and `release`. No product flavors: the "flavors" are the application modules `app` and `dev3-app` |

## Configuration that changes what the user sees

`app_config.xml` (one per application module) decides: the server, the login method (`basic`,
`openid`, `both`), the guest mode ("Continue without signing in"), the location tag, whether the
patient lists are filtered by location, whether live mode starts on, the registration form, whether
identifiers are fetched, and optional form sections. This guide documents the **`dev3-app`**
configuration (password login, no guest mode, identifiers fetched, live mode on at first start) and
says where another configuration changes the screen.

## Screens

Entry point: the launcher starts `SplashActivity`, which decides where to go.

| Id | Screen | How to reach it | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| S01 | Splash | Launch the app | Decides: login, lock screen or home |

## Permissions

`INTERNET`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` (the connection banner and the sync conditions), `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
(asked on Android 13 and newer, for the sync notification), `USE_BIOMETRIC` (offline login). The camera
is used by the QR scanner (`SettingsScanActivity`; the library asks the permission).
No location permission: the "location" in the app is a place of work chosen from a list, not GPS.

## Roles

No role selection in the app. What a user can see is decided by the server (the account's privileges:
for instance an encounter type the account cannot see is refused on upload).

## i18n mechanism

`core/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` (English) and `values-fr`, `values-es`, `values-ru`,
`values-ar`. The language is chosen in Settings (AppCompat per-app locales). Form texts come from the
questionnaires (their own translations). `StringResourcesTest` checks that the tutorial texts exist in
all five languages.

## Tablet-specific layouts

None. `values-sw600dp/dimens.xml` is empty; there is no list-detail, navigation rail or split pane.
A tablet shows the phone layout, wider, and the app rotates freely (no orientation lock on the
main activities). The guide says so in the introduction and shows landscape screenshots.

## Needs real infrastructure (and how the guide handles it)

| Item | Handling |
|---|---|
| A real OpenMRS server | A local fake backend (`fake-backend/`) |
| Single sign-on (Keycloak) | Not in the `dev3-app` configuration; described only in the text, no screenshot |
| QR scanning (camera) | The scanner screen is captured only if the emulator camera works; otherwise a placeholder |
| Fingerprint / face prompts | System dialogs; described in the text, captured only if the emulator can show them |
| Notifications | Android system UI, not captured |
| The mail app (diagnostics) | Not captured |
